This is a mini project used to delete cache from browsers in order to allow external control over the cache data.

With the assumption that the cache folder won't be changed frequently, the program could delete cache external after examining that the last modified date has at least 5 minutes old ( or any other configuration )

The program was developed in mac and tested on mac. Test on windows would be arranged later.
